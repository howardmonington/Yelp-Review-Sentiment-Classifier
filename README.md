# Positive/Negative Yelp Review NLP Classifier

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to use NLP to classify Yelp reviews into positive reviews (4-5 stars) and negative reviews (1-2 stars). NLP is defined as a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.

## Project Description
The Yelp dataset contains a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data for use in personal, educational, and academic purposes. In this project, I focused on the Yelp reviews dataset. This contained over 7 million reviews and their associated star rating. I split the reviews into positive reviews (4 or 5 stars) and negative reviews (1 or 2 stars), then trained several neural networks to classify the reviews into their correct positive/negative categories. After training the neural networks, I was able to achieve 97.7% accuracy on the test set, which had never been seen before by the model.
