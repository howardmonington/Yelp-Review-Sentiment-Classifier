# Positive/Negative Yelp Review NLP Classifier

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
NLP is defined as a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. It is commonly used in technologies such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and modern spam detection. There are many opportunities in NLP due to the sheer volume of data and scale of NLP related tasks. The purpose of this project is to use NLP to classify Yelp reviews into positive reviews (4-5 stars) and negative reviews (1-2 stars).

## Project Description
The Yelp dataset contains a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data for use in personal, educational, and academic purposes. In this project, I focused on the Yelp reviews dataset. This contained over 7 million reviews and their associated star rating. I split the reviews into positive reviews (4 or 5 stars) and negative reviews (1 or 2 stars), then trained several neural networks to classify the reviews into their correct positive/negative categories. After training the neural networks, I was able to achieve 97.7% accuracy on the test set.
