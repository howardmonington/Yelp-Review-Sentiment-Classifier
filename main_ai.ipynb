It\\'s what real estate agents would call \"cozy\" or \"charming\" - basically any euphemism for small.\\n\\nThat being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:\\n\\n* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.\\n* it\\'s not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don\\'t bring them.\\n* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to \"just look around\" and \"do whatever.\" \\n\\nAt such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.',\n",
       "       'I am actually horrified this place is still in business. My 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $7 kids cut signs got me in the door. We had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. The decor in this place is total garbage. It is so tacky. The sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. And my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. It was disgusting and I should have walked out then. Actually, I should have turned around and walked out upon entering but I didn\\'t. So the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it\\'s our turn. I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn\\'t cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all. After about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, I said \"you know what? That\\'s fine.\", paid and left. All I wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place.\\n\\nBottom line: DO NOT GO HERE. RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!!!',\n",
       "       \"I love Deagan's. I do. I really do. The atmosphere is cozy and festive. The shrimp tacos and house fries are my standbys. The fries are sometimes good and sometimes great, and the spicy dipping sauce they come with is to die for. The beer list is amazing and the cocktails are great. The prices are mid-level, so it's not a cheap dive you can go to every week, but rather a treat when you do. Try it out. You won't be disappointed!\",\n",

Estimated delivery date was for 12-10-19.\\nNever got any updates on if it was showing up on that date or another date.\\nToday while sitting in my living room with the door open, something makes a loud noise at my front door. OnTrac Delivery service that they use threw the box 3 feet from the door. I jumped up so fast, but the person that brought it up did not even speak or ring the door bell, they just threw the box and walked away so dang fast. So fast I couldn't see if it was a guy or a girl.\\nAfter being thrown to the ground, Home Depot I sure hope the heating elements didn't get hurt.\\nHome Depot, really use FedEx or UPS, so things get to the customers without the items being thrown here to there.\",\n",
       "       \"I'm honestly not sure how I have never been to this place before. I'm definitely going to keep it on my list of coffee shops to visit to work remote. It's the cutest place! I'm honestly obsessed now.\\n\\nI met some ladies here for a work meeting and it was rather peaceful. Some coffee shops can be so noisy. But this place was really quiet in the best way possible. There were some other customers in there meeting as well. There's plenty of places to sit and they have some lounge furniture as well, which makes it all the more that much more inviting.\\n\\nI opted to try the Sin City, which is one of their custom drinks. I believe it was coffee, chocolate sauce, milk and caramel. They made it iced for me and put it in the cutest glass that made me feel like I was at a 50's diner. It was soooo good! I didn't finish it in time as I had to jet to another meeting, so I took the rest to go in a to-go cup.\\n\\nThe staff was kind and patient. I even missed when they called my name out for the drink, but one of the nice baristas brought it out to me instead, even though she really didn't have to do it.\\n\\nIf you love coffee shops and are in the neighborhood, pay this place a visit and get the Sin City. You're welcome in advance!\",\n",
       "       \"Oh yeah! Not only that the service was good, the food is good the serving is good and the service is amazing. The best part is the price is really good.\\nA perfect location with lots of parking and the place looks really clean. They have an awesome lunch special that is too plenty making it very filling for the price that you're paying for. That is why this is one of the Japanese restaurants that I recommend for lunch specials with friends ,colleagues,Or if you are just lazy to cook. I love this place I will keep coming back here.\"],\n",
